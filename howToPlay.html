            For Hang Man, there are two modes
            to choose from; Random Word and Select Word.

        </p>
        <p>
            Random Word is a game mode where the computer
            chooses the word for you instead of another player
            having to choose for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Select Word is a game mode where another player
            chooses the word for you.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the word has been chosen, the guessing player will
            have to type out letters within the letter input box
            and the game will output if the letter correctly fits
            inside the blank word spaces.
